# movie-seat-booking
 
A simple responsive project where the user is able to select the displayed movie seats for the selected movie in order to purchase tickets. 
---
Here, the user can select a movie, then the user can select or deselect the seats in the seats grid. The user cannot select the seat that is already selected. The number of seats and the cost will get updated based on user selection. The seats, prices and movie selection will get saved to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh.
